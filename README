has_components
==============

This idea began as a way of specifying potentially configurable
components (i.e. a lens can be put into one of 10 different frames).
Right now it appears to be a method of defining has_many :through
relations really quickly without having to create lots of join tables
and models manually.  Not sure where it'll go from here.

Start off by creating a migration that has:

  create_table :component_relations do |t|
    t.column :first_id, :integer
    t.column :second_id, :integer
    t.column :type, :string
  end

Then in the models that you want a has_many :through, just call has_components instead:

  class Lens
    has_components :frames
  end

  Lens.find(2).frames << Frames.find(345)

etc
